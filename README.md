# Git Folder Pusher  
Unity Editor tool for staging, committing, and pushing changes to a Git repository directly from the Unity interface.

## Features
- Adds "Git Commit and Push" option under `Assets/` menu if the selected folder contains a `.git` directory.  
- Validates whether uncommitted changes exist before enabling the menu item.  
- On activation, opens a modal EditorWindow displaying changed files with status labels.  
- Scrollable file list dynamically fills available vertical space.  
- Allows typing a commit message and triggers `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` operations.  
- Handles empty commit messages by inserting a zero-width character.  
- Captures and logs Git stdout/stderr to Unity's console for debugging.  
- Parses `git status --porcelain` output to extract file paths and corresponding Git status codes.  
- Status codes mapped to human-readable labels such as "Untracked", "Modified", "Deleted", etc.  
- Opens the window only when a valid Git repository folder is selected.
